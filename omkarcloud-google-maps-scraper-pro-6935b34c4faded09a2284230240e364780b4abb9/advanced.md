## ü§î Advanced Questions

### ‚ùì I don't have Python, or I'm facing errors when setting up the scraper on my PC. How to solve it?

You can easily run the scraper in Gitpod, a browser-based development environment. Set it up in just 5 minutes by following these steps:

1. Visit [this link](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper) and sign up using your GitHub account.

2. Once signed up, open it in Gitpod.

3. In the terminal, run the following command to start scraping:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
  
4. Once the scraper has finished running, download the data from the `output` folder.

Just like with a local setup, you can configure the scraper in Gitpod by editing the `main.py` file and running the scraper using the `python main.py` command.

Also, it's important to regularly interact with the Gitpod environment, such as clicking within it every 30 minutes, to keep the machine active and prevent automatic shutdown. 

If you don't want to click every 30 minutes, then we encourage you to install Python on your PC and run the scraper locally. 

### ‚ùì Does running Scraper on a Bigger Machine scrape Data Faster?

No, the scraper is very light on resources, so there won't be any noticeable difference whether you run it on an Intel Pentium processor with 4GB of RAM or an Intel i7 processor with 16GB of RAM.

### ‚ùì How to Scrape Reviews?

You can set the `scrape_reviews` argument to true.

```python
queries = [
   "web developers in Bangalore"
]

Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, max=5)
```

You can also configure the following options:
- reviews_max (Defaults: 20)
- reviews_sort (Defaults: Newest)
- Options are Most Relevant, Newest, Highest Rating, Lowest Rating

Here is an example that scrapes the Lowest Rated, 100 Reviews.
```python
queries = [
   "web developers in Bangalore"
]

Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, reviews_max=100, reviews_sort=Gmaps.LOWEST_RATING, max=5)
```

To scrape all reviews without any limit, you can set `reviews_max` to `Gmaps.ALL_REVIEWS`. 

```python
queries = [
   "web developers in Bangalore"
]

Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, reviews_max=Gmaps.ALL_REVIEWS, max=5)
```

Some places may have thousands of reviews, so scraping all reviews may take a long time. 

So, it's best to limit the number of reviews to scrape to a number like 100 or 1000.

Please note that for privacy concerns, reviewer's personal information such as name, and review profile link are not scraped. Only the review text, rating, response, etc., are scraped.

Also, to allow you to uniquely identify reviews and at the same time protect the reviewer's privacy, we hash the reviewer's id. 

### ‚ùì What are Popular Snippets for Data Scientists?

- Scrape 100 Newest Google Maps Places Reviews of a Country and Store the result as JSON.

```python
from botasaurus import bt

queries = Gmaps.Cities.India("your_target in")

scraped_places = Gmaps.places(queries, scrape_reviews=True, reviews_max=100, max=5)
bt.write_json(result, "scraped_places.json")
```


- Read the Data for Panda Analysis

```python
from botasaurus import bt

scraped_places = bt.read_json("scraped_places.json")
# Do whatever you want with scraped_places
```

### ‚ùì How to Change the Language of Output?
Pass the `lang` argument.

For example, if you want to scrape results in Spanish, you can do so by passing `lang="Gmaps.Lang.Spanish"`.

```python
queries = [
   "web developers in Bangalore"
]
Gmaps.places(queries, lang=Gmaps.Lang.Spanish)
```

All Google Maps languages are supported. Some popular languages you may want to use are:
- Gmaps.Lang.Spanish
- Gmaps.Lang.English
- Gmaps.Lang.Chinese
- Gmaps.Lang.Japanese
- And of course, Gmaps.Lang.Hindi üòä

See the list of all supported languages [here](https://github.com/omkarcloud/google-maps-scraper/blob/master/languages.md).

### ‚ùì I have Google Map Places Links, How to Scrape Links?

Use the `links` method to scrape information from specific Google Maps place links. Here's an example:

```python
links = [
   "https://www.google.com/maps/place/Zinavo-+Web+Development,+Web+Design+Company+in+Bangalore,+SEO+Services,+Digital+Marketing+Agency,+eCommerce+Web+Development/@13.01443,77.6480612,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bae172f3e7069f1:0xbcac5b2d393c2aa2!8m2!3d13.01443!4d77.6480612!16s%2Fg%2F11h0l3y9l?authuser=0&hl=en&entry=ttu",
   "https://www.google.com/maps/place/SeekNEO+-+Web+Development,+Web+Design+Company+in+Bangalore,+eCommerce+Web+Development,+SEO+Services,+Digital+Marketing+Agency/@12.9863763,77.5473899,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x3bae13ac4bcc6641:0x1bf48a7dee3d5a51!8m2!3d12.9863763!4d77.5473899!16s%2Fg%2F11g2338zrl?authuser=0&hl=en&entry=ttu"
]
output_folder = "my-awesome-places"

Gmaps.links(links, output_folder)
```

### ‚ùì How to Scrape at Particular Coordinates and Zoom Level?

Provide the coordinates to the scraper as follows:

```python
queries = [
   "web developers in Bangalore"
]

Gmaps.places(queries, geo_coordinates="12.900490, 77.571466", max=5)
```

You can also adjust the zoom level, which will zoom in to the location before scraping:

- 1 (Whole Planet)
- 21 (House Level)

Zooming results in more places being scraped within a smaller area. Below is the same map at different zoom levels, yielding different numbers of results.

For example, to scrape places in Bangalore at zoom level 16:

```python
queries = [
   "web developers in Bangalore"
]

Gmaps.places(queries, geo_coordinates="12.900490, 77.571466", zoom=16, max=5)
```


### ‚ùì When setting the Lang Attribute to Hindi/Japanese/Chinese, the characters are in English instead of the specified language. How to transform characters to the specified language?

By default, we convert any non-English characters to English characters. For example, "‡§≠‡§æ‡§∞‡§§" gets converted to "Bharat".

We do this because Excel can't render non-English characters properly.

If you want to retain the original characters and not convert them to English, then set the `convert_to_english` parameter to `False` as follows:

```python
queries = [
   "web developers in Bangalore"
]
Gmaps.places(queries, lang=Gmaps.Lang.Hindi, convert_to_english=False, max=5)
```

Also, in case you are unable to view characters properly in Excel, then the easiest solution is to upload the CSV to Google Sheets, which should render the characters properly.
